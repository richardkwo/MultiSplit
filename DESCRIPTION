Description: Statistical tests are sometimes constructed with data splitting. 
    When such tests are applied to data, the result can depend on the way the 
    data is split, which is typically random. Therefore, on a dataset, the result 
    of a test is random and not replicable. Further, such tests typically have low power
    because the full sample is not utlized. This package properly aggregates the results
    from multiple data splits and reports the p-value of the aggregated statistic. The 
    constructed test has level that asymptotically approaches the nominal level. Typically, 
    by aggregating results from a sufficiently large number of data splits, the test 
    becomes replicable and much more powerful. This package implements a generic 
    method that handles any test that is constructed with "extra randomness", including
    random data splitting, resampling, imputation, etc.
